# tinyos-env

A couple of different pre-built environments for building tinyos programs, I mainly use(d) them for practical lessons where I had to interface with a Shimmer2r.
They are all available on my  [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/abathargh/tinyos).

## Usage

If you use an image with a tag ending in **nocode**, you have to use a local copy of the tinyos git repo and mount it as a volume in the **/tinyos** container dir. 
It's very important that you run the container with the **--privileged** flag to make it have access to the serial interfaceof the host machine; you can also use the **--device** 
flag, specifying the serial interface identifying the device you're using.

For images without the **nocode** tag:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged -it abathargh/tinyos:<tag> bash
```

For images with the **nocode** tag:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged -it -v /path/to/tinyos:/tinyos abathargh/tinyos:<tag> bash
```

### Usage on ARM machines

You can use these images on ARM machines by emulating the x86_64 arch via qemu:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static
cp /usr/bin/qemu-x86_64-static .
docker run -v $(pwd)/qemu-x86_64-static:/usr/bin/qemu-x86_64-static --privileged --rm -it abathargh/tinyos:msp430-debian9 bash 
```
